    "# Query Reformulation Supported by Knowledge Bases on Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing quality, cost, and latency are some of the most important factors when developing RAG-based GenAI applications. Very often, input queries to an Foundation Model (FM) can be very complex with many questions and complex relationships. With such complex queries, the embedding step may mask or dilute important components of the query, resulting in retrieved chunks that may not provide context for all aspects of the query. This can produce a less than desirable response from your RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with query reformulation, we can take a complex input prompt and break it down into multiple sub-queries. These sub-queries will then separately go through their own retrieval steps for relevant chunks. The resulting chunks will then be pooled and ranked together before passing them to the FM to generate a response. Query reformulation is another tool we can use which can help increase accuracy for complex queries that your application may face in production.\n"

We have an ESG risk management program to minimize this risk, but we cannot eliminate it entirely. For example, our investment in a coal-fired power plant has exposed us to reputational and financial risks due to growing concerns about climate change.   ### Foreign Exchange Risk   Octank Financial is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to the possibility that changes in exchange rates could negatively impact the value of our investments or our financial results. We have a foreign exchange risk management program to minimize this risk, but we cannot eliminate it entirely. For instance, our investment in a Brazilian manufacturing company has exposed us to currency risks due to the volatility of the Brazilian real.
